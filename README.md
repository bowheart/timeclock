# timeclock

This is just a project I created for tracking my time as a freelancer working on multiple projects billable to different people.

You can use it if you want, but it's really just a me thing that I published to showcase some skills.

## Features

- Easy task-switching.
- Hour breakdown by day, pay-period, and all-time.
- Auto-populate an email to send hours-last-pay-period to client.

## Tech

- React (with react-router)
- Redux (with react-redux, redux-observable, redux-actions)
- Rxjs
- Express
- GraphQL
- Diskdb (a light-weight mongo replacement)
- Webpack (hmr-enabled)
